# data-sourcing-challenge
This challenge was definitly very challenging for a non-technical backgrounded person.  Although I was able to get a good start with the first portion of the challenge, it took me hours upon hours to figure out the code, which is not a problem as I understand this is how we learn.  Unfortunately, there just were not enough hours in each day to complete all of the questions/portions of the challenge. For my code, I relied upon class notes, Xpert Learning, and some of the code taken for the API sites and a Python site.  I do feel that I'm learning how to research code technics and hopefully I'll continue to get better at it.
